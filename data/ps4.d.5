.Sh NAME
.Nm ps4.d
.Nd PS4 configuration directory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bl -item -compact
.It
/etc/ps4.d/*.conf
.It
/usr/share/ps4.d/*.conf
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
configuration directory sets properties for the ps4 package manager.
The
.Sy configuration
directory, by default set to
.Sy /etc/ps4.d
overrides settings from files available in the
.Sy system configuration
directory, by default set to
.Sy /usr/share/ps4.d .
.Pp
Files in the
.Sy configuration
directory have preference over files in the
.Sy system configuration
directory.
.Pp
Only files with the
.Em .conf
extension will be processed in alphabetical order.
.Pp
The configuration files can set various
.Em keywords ,
using the syntax
.Sy `key=value` .
No whitespace between the
.Em key
and its
.Em value
is allowed, nor trailing whitespaces after its value.
Multiple entries are permitted for the
.Sy ignorepkg ,
.Sy include ,
.Sy noextract ,
.Sy preserve ,
.Sy repository
and
.Sy virtualpkg
keywords, but each entry must specify only one value.
.Sh KEYWORDS
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Sy architecture=string
Overrides the native machine architecture, as reported by
.Xr uname 2 .
.It Sy bestmatching=true|false
When this keyword is enabled, a package with the greatest version available in
all registered repositories will be chosen.
This will be applied to dependencies as well.
.It Sy cachedir=path
Sets the default cache directory to store downloaded binary packages from
remote repositories, as well as its signatures.
If path starts with '/' it's an absolute path, otherwise it will be relative to
.Ar rootdir .
.It Sy ignorepkg=pkgname
Declares an ignored package.
If a package depends on an ignored package the dependency is always satisfied,
without installing the ignored package.
It does not disable checks for introduced incompatibilities
like shared library dependencies.
.It Sy noextract=pattern
Skip extraction of matching files.
Patterns starting with a exclamation mark negate the previous match,
a single backslash can be used to escape the exclamation mark.
.Pp
In the following example all files matching the first pattern will not be extracted,
but files that also match the second pattern will still be extracted.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width noextract=!/usr/bin/foo
.It Sy noextract=/usr/bin/f*
.It Sy noextract=!/usr/bin/foo
.El
.It Sy include=path/file.conf
Imports settings from the specified configuration file.
.Em NOTE
only one level of nesting is allowed.
.It Sy preserve=path
If set ignores modifications to the specified files, while unpacking packages.
Absolute path to a file and file globbing are supported, example:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width preserve=/etc/foo/*.conf
.It Sy preserve=/usr/bin/foo
.It Sy preserve=/etc/foo/*.conf
.El
.It Sy keepconf=true|false
If set to false (default), ps4 will overwrite configuration files that have
not been changed since installation with their new version (if available).
.Pp
If set to true, ps4 will not overwrite configuration files that have not
been changed since installation. Instead, the new version (if available) is
saved next to the configuration file as <name>.new-<version>.
.Pp
.It Sy repository=url
Declares a package repository. The
.Ar url
argument accepts local and remote repositories.
A complete url or absolute path to the directory that stores the
.Em <arch>-repodata
archive is expected.
Note that remote repositories must be signed using
.Xr ps4-rindex 1 ,
example:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width repository=https://repo-default.voidlinux.org/current
.It Sy repository=https://repo-default.voidlinux.org/current
.It Sy repository=/hostdir/binpkgs
.El
.It Sy rootdir=path
Sets the default root directory.
.It Sy staged=true|false
Enables or disables the use of staged packages in remote repositories.
.It Sy syslog=true|false
Enables or disables syslog logging. Enabled by default.
.It Sy virtualpkg=[vpkgname|vpkgver]:pkgname
Declares a virtual package. A virtual package declaration is composed by two
components delimited by a colon, example:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width virtualpkg=cron-daemon:dcron
.It Sy virtualpkg=cron-daemon:dcron
Any request to the
.Ar cron-daemon
virtual package will be resolved to the
.Ar dcron
real package.
.El
.Pp
The first component expects a
.Em virtual package name and optionally its version component .
The second component expects a
.Em package name
to match the real package.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ps4_TARGET_ARCH
.It Sy ps4_ARCH
Overrides
.Xr uname 2
machine result with this value. Useful to install packages with a fake
architecture.
.It Sy ps4_TARGET_ARCH
Sets the target architecture to this value. This variable differs from
.Sy ps4_ARCH
in that it allows you to install packages partially, because
configuration phase is skipped (the target binaries might not be compatible with
the native architecture).
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/db/ps4/.<pkgname>-files.plist
.It Ar /etc/ps4.d
Default configuration directory.
.It Ar /usr/share/ps4.d
Default system configuration directory.
.It Ar /var/db/ps4/.<pkgname>-files.plist
Package files metadata.
.It Ar /var/db/ps4/pkgdb-0.38.plist
Default package database (0.38 format). Keeps track of installed packages and properties.
.It Ar /var/cache/ps4
Default cache directory to store downloaded binary packages.
.It Ar /usr/share/ps4.d/ps4.conf
Annotated sample configuration file.
